You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\"So he stuck the photo in the face of the 1st blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"did you notice any distinguishing features about the man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He has only one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of course he has only one eye in this picture! It's a profile of his face!

This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts...

The lawyer asks the first question. \"What's the distance from the earth to the moon?\" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?\" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references.He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress.

The blonde politely takes the $500 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, \"Well, so what IS the answer!?\" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.",
